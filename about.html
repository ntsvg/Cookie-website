    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">At Telugu Treats, we don’t just bake cookies—we craft experiences infused with tradition, passion, and authenticity. Rooted in the rich culinary heritage of Andhra Pradesh, every cookie is a celebration of time-honored recipes, perfected across generations.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Our journey began with a simple mission: to bring the flavors of our childhood to life, one cookie at a time. Each bite transports you to a world where the aroma of freshly baked goods fills the air, and the warmth of home is felt in every crumb.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">We take pride in using only the finest, all-natural ingredients—premium ghee, jaggery, nuts, and aromatic spices—ensuring that our cookies are not just delicious but also a wholesome treat. Handcrafted with love and care, each batch is a testament to our commitment to quality and authenticity.</p>

With each bite, you’re not just tasting a cookie—you’re embracing an heirloom of flavors, a legacy of craftsmanship, and the heartfelt warmth of home.</p>
